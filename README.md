# Trash2trees
🌱 Trash2Trees

Trash2Trees is a smart, citizen-driven waste management system that bridges the gap between the public and municipal authorities. It enables easy reporting of waste bin issues while rewarding users for contributing to a cleaner and greener environment.

🚀 Project Overview

Urban areas often face problems like overflowing, missing, or damaged waste bins due to delayed monitoring and lack of public involvement. GreenBin Connect solves this by allowing citizens to report bin issues instantly using a mobile application. Municipal authorities can monitor, verify, and resolve issues through a centralized dashboard.

To promote sustainability, the system rewards users with eco points, digital certificates, and tree saplings for verified reports—turning waste reporting into an environmental initiative.

✨ Key Features

📱 Mobile-based waste reporting

🔍 QR code scanning for intact bins

📍 GPS location & photo upload for missing/damaged bins

🖥️ Municipal dashboard for monitoring and task assignment

🌿 Eco points reward system

📜 Digital certificates & tree sapling rewards

🧠 How It Works

Citizens scan a QR code on the bin or upload a photo with GPS location.

The report is stored in a centralized database.

Municipal administrators verify the issue via the dashboard.

Tasks are assigned to field workers.

Once resolved, the status is updated with proof images.

Users receive eco points for verified reports.

On reaching milestones, users earn certificates and tree saplings.
